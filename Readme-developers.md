# Developer notes

`npm pack` will create `angular-typesafe-reactive-forms-helper-1.0.0.tgz`

## Consume in another app for testing

`~/workspace/some-application$` `npm install ~/angular-typesafe-reactive-forms-helper-0.0.0.tgz`

This is only if you don't want to go to public npm registry or for testing before you publish.
